#BFV weapon stats parser

mostly works.
it eats text copy-pasted from http://bfdata.juhala.io/misc/bfv_overture_05122018.html or similar resource with the exact same format.
header should be deleted manually beforehand.
processed text forms tab-separated file named bfv.csv

#TODO
* parse text directly from link
* consider columns order handling
* publish results somewhere
